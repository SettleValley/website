### About myself

Creating and building creative idea

I'm Software Engineer  student from Panama. Always thinking of
new ideas that can improve and optimize some procees in the industry. I like
to learn new software skills and try to share with others, ofcourse I play so
much VideoGame, prefer a PC Master Race. I considered myself pragmatic.
