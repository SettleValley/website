### About myself

*Creating and building creative idea*

I'm a Software Engineer, currently working for BlueTide Web Consulting at Ciudad del Saber. 
Iâ€™m trying to come up with new ideas that can improve and optimize some processes in the industry. Sometimes I get some interesting ideas that may work once implemented, 
but some of them are just for fun and to improve myself / my skills. In my free time, I spend my time on Youtube watching Platzi News or Netflix series. 
I would like to go on trips to explore new cultures, especially Asian cultures. I can't stop playing video games, because I liked playing them on my PC ever since I was a child. 
I believe I still have many things to discover.
