## About myself

*Creating and building creative idea*

I'm a Software Engineer, currently working with BlueTide Web Consulting at Ciudad del Saber. Trying to think new ideas that can improve and optimize some process in the industry, sometimes i get some funny ideas that may work once implemented, but some of them are just for fun and to improve myself. In my free time I spend my time on youtube watching Platzi News or Netflix series. I would like to take some trips to explore new cultures, I'm interested in Asian Culture. I can't leave behind Videogames, since childhood I really like to play on my PC videogames. Yep, and I still have to discover more things.
